Guide for my portfolio and personal projects:

1. **Personal Project: MAL Recommender System using KNNWithMeans and SVD** | NumPy, pandas, Surprise | Nov 2024 - Now

Github repo: https://github.com/Mashalk199/MALRecommenderSystem

• Created a KNN with means implementation of a recommender system with raw numpy and pandas, without using any external ML libraries. Implemented separate recommender system with external libraries to benchmark model performance using the Surprise scikit-learn library. 

• Created a pipeline to analyse the user anime list of a myanimelist.net account user, and generate recommendations for the user.

• Working on implementing the SVD algorithm to the dataset to improve recommendation performance.

2. **MIMIC-IV Dysglycemia Prediction** | Pytorch, Tensorflow, NumPy  | Mar 2025 – June 2025

Project Presentation: https://youtu.be/p5WLVTqJOMo?si=fWFqYHI2URlAWGSN

• Worked in a group of 5 to conduct a combined 50 research paper literature review to learn researched
techniques and understand the problem to predict time-series glucose outcomes for ICU patients.

• Utilised cutting-edge machine/deep learning techniques like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Phased LSTM,
SVR, XGBoost ensemble trees for continuous and classification regression.

• Achieved results competitive with established literature on predicting dysglycemia, improving on some
literature model’s error scores by 13%.

3. **VetCare** | Java, Thymeleaf, Spring Boot, Bootstrap, Docker, MySQL, AWS, Mockito | Aug 2023 – Oct 2023

• Developed a pet care full-stack web application with a wide range of features developed, including clinic appointment booking, pet records, prescription and treatment plan management with AWS email notifications.

• Group effort of 6 people, implementing a Scrum methodology with significant focus on communication and
teamwork.

• Followed a test-driven-development approach, testing frontend and backend components, utilized CI/CD
pipelines and docker containerization.

4. **Natural Language Processing with job listings** | Gensim, NLTK, Regex | Sept 2022 – Oct 2022

• Performed comprehensive natural language processing on a job listings dataset, using regex to clean thousands of
instances of data, NLTK to tokenize and perform stemming and lemmatization processing. This is a project of its own, separate from the next one.

• Utilized FastText for training word-embedding models, created my own word-embedding model to test against and
used the best models to power a small-scale AI job listings application for classifying job descriptions.

5. **Indigenous People’s Outcomes website** | SQL, Javalin, JDBC, HTML, CSS, Git | Sept 2021 – Oct 2021

• Created a relational database from Australian census data with a script and queried using JDBC to display data on
frontend.

• Performed comprehensive usability-testing for website features, user requirements analysis and user testing with
scenarios.

6. **SuperPrice** | Java, React, RESTful API, Docker, Spring Boot | Aug 2023 – Oct 2023

In order to run the website, please extract Superprice.zip file and read the README.md file.

• Developed a shopping full-stack web application in Java, SpringBoot, React, Docker and TypeScript. Utilizing a
REST API with React as the frontend and a H2 backend.

• Group effort of 5 people, implementing a Scrum methodology where I served as the Product Owner, setting and
managing tasks on GitHub project scrum boards.

• Performed comprehensive tests on HTML and rest API results following a test-driven-development framework.

7. **Vending Machine** | C++, Makefile, Regex | Apr 2023 – May 2023

• Created a C++ program called Penelope’s Pastry Delights which acts as a vending machine. Purchases can be made and change is given based on the particular balance of coins
contained in the vending machine. Treats can be added, deleted, edited, etc.

• Utilized principles of structured programming, so no break statements and no methods with multiple return
statements. All memory is managed with correct practices and handled by appropriate object users.

8. **AWS hosted music website** | Flask, AWS EC2, S3, API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB | Mar 2023 – Apr 2023

• Set up multiple Amazon web services and utilized serverless lambda functions to query data from database from
an API endpoint trigger in the website.

9. **Classifying Histopathelogy Cancer Cell Images** | TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-Learn | Apr 2023 – May 2023

• Utilised various deep learning techniques along with convolutional neural network models to classify images in
the CRCHistoPhenotypes dataset.

• Improved training performance with hyperparameter tuning and model structural experimentation and
analysis.
